# dwm.6.2
My dwm build with desired patches applied, moulded for thinkpad x220.

The autostarts patch is applied so edit config.def.h to define your own chosen autostarts.

The only other thing of note is that PREFIX = "$HOME"/.local is defined in config.mk, edit to suit or edit ~/.xinitrc to exec ~/.local/bin/dwm
